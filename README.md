# Transports-parisian-region-2000-2020
Last project of the University of Michigan's Applied Plotting Charting &amp; Data Representation with Python

This project consists of a Jupyter notebook investigating the evolution of public transport usage in parisian region over time from 2000 to 2020. Two plots are given: one which shows the total per capita trafic for each modal type and other that gives each modal type's percentual contribution relatively to all transport types.

The visual shows how public transport has evolved over time in two ways:
* The first plot gives the absolute increase in transport flux over time. From it, it's possible to see that overall the public transport usage per capita has increased (excluding 2020, because of the COVID pandemic) for virtually all modal types.
* The second plot shows another insight, however. Even though absolute numbers have increased, the dynamics between different modals seems to have changed. Tramway usage seems to be ever-increasing, while metro and bus percentual contributions decrease in general. Train usage is mainly steady.
